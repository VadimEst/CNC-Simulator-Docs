This getting started guide assumes that the repository is already present on your local machine as described under [Contribute](contribute).

 ## Run project

Because of the Maven-managed dependencies the project can be executed with the same command on all platforms. To simplify the execution create a run configuration in your used IDE.
 ```
mvn javafx:run
 ```

---

## Build project

To create a build use the `pom.xml` and configure the launch script for the specific platform. The binaries for the programm will be generated by Maven in the `target` folder.
```
mvn javafx:jlink
```
