:::caution

This project is not intended to be maintained after the goals defined in the [scoping document](/docs/dev/scoping) are fulfilled, because this project is part of the "Advanced Development" lecture of WWISCB19 at DHBW Mannheim. Functionality defined during the implementation will be added to the scoping document and will be tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/timonweide/CNC-Simulator/issues).
