## Graphical interface (in Java FX)

- Workspace GREY
- Drill/mortising machine RED
- Milled area BLACK
- Home GREEN
- Current Position, spindle status (On/Off + sense of rotation), coolant status, speed

## Commands

### Execution of single commands
  - Automatic counting of commands
  - Checking a command before execution (checking the following command while the first is being executed)
### Execution of multiple commands
  - Manual counting of the commands by the user
  - Checking the whole command set before the first execution
  - Input? ïƒ Textarea/Import via JSON/XML
### Possibility to pause current command or cancel command set
### G-Commands (Way-functions)
  - G00: Verfahrbewegung im Eilgang (only without drilling/milling possible)
  - G01: straight (linear) Interpolation
  - G02: feed with circular arc, clockwise (circle Interpolation)
  - G03: feed with circular arc, anticlockwise
  - G28: return to HOME position
### M-Commands (Control-functions)
  - M00: programme stop (spindle, coolant, Vorschub aus)
  - M02: programme end
  - M03: spindle on: clockwise (right)
  - M04: spindle on: anticlockwise (left)
  - M05: spindle stop
  - M08: coolant on
  - M09: coolant off
  - M13: spindle on, clockwise and coolant on
  - M14: spindle on, anticlockwise and coolant on
