# CNC-Simulator Documentation

This documentation is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation


### Local Development

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

To deploy the changes to the [live site](https://docs.cnc.timon.cloud/) push your changes to the repository. The changes will be pulled to the webserver automatically.
